For hosting my site I used GitHub Pages since its free & easy to setup

1. Create GitHub account
2. Crate new public repo
3. Upload site to repo
4. Go to repo settings
5. Go to Pages tab
6. Under branch select desired branch for prod
7. Press save
8. The site will then be available at https://<user>.github.io/<repository>

Note: the root page must be named index.html so for this repo first_page.html was renamed to index.html
